In our exploration of the dataset titled ‘Impacts of anthropization on mosquitoes’ from Kaggle, we went deep into the specifics of human influence on mosquito populations. Instead of relying on visualizations, we chose to work on a detailed table to transmit the information of this professional dataset.
The features considered in this analysis are as follows:
•	‘geographic_country’
•	‘disturbance_type’ : Divided into two crucial categories - urbanization and agriculture.
