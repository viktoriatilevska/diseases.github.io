					<h2>Introduction</h2>
					<p>
						Our project focuses on analyzing malaria-related fatalities within African countries.
						Our decision to focus only on Africa stemmed from observing the global data, which highlighted
						Africa as the continent most significantly affected by malaria fatalities.
						Malaria remains a persistent issue in Africa, evident from the forthcoming visualizations
						that show the alarming number of deaths. It stands as one of the primary causes of death in Africa.
					</p>
					<p>
						Our analysis covers data from 1991 to 2019, allowing us to trace the growing
						trend of fatalities over these years. Additionally, we aim to go into the factors
						contributing to this problem, particularly examining human activities that have 
						affected mosquito populations. Now, let's explore the visualizations to gain an
						understanding of this issue.

							The first map illustrates malaria death rates in African countries over 30 years, displaying the proportion of deaths relative to the population in each country.
						</p>
						<p id="explanation2" class="explanation" style="display: none;">
							The second map outlines the total number of malaria-related deaths across African countries during this 30-year period. Notably, Nigeria and the Democratic Republic of the Congo stand out with the highest numbers of deaths.
						</p>
						<p id="explanation3" class="explanation" style="display: none;"> 
							In the third map, we can see the most affected African region. To achieve this, we excluded Nigeria and the Democratic Republic of the Congo from the analysis as their significant figures overshadowed the impact on other countries. This adjustment revealed that Central Africa is the most affected region by malaria.

							between 1990 and 2019. Nigeria consistently stands out with the highest annual death toll,
							followed by the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).
							<br> While the rankings of other countries change, their numbers remain notably lower 
							compared to Nigeria. It is important to note that this graph doesn't consider population

							The area chart shows the age groups most impacted by malaria-related deaths over the years.
							It indicates that the highest number of deaths occurs among children under 5 years old, 
							likely due to their weaker immune systems. Following this group are individuals aged 15 to 49,
							and then those aged 50 to 69. This trend might be attributed to the increased outdoor activities
							among these age brackets, posing a higher risk of mosquito bites. The least affected age groups
							are the ones with individuals of 5 to 14 and those above 70.
						</p>
						<p>
							The graph highlights that children under 5 years old face the greatest risk of mortality from malaria.

					<h2>Anthropization</h2>

					<p>
						From our analysis correlating antropization factors such as agriculture and urbanization with mosquito
						populations, the table reveals different countries experiencing negative effects due to these factors.
						Several countries are affected negatively, implying that their agricultural and urban development
						practices contribute to increased mosquito populations.	
					</p>
					<p>
						The impact is linked to the destruction of wetlands, which serve as natural habitats for mosquitoes.
						As agriculture and urbanization destroy these areas, mosquitoes are forced to relocate to urban 
						settings, relying on human blood as their primary source of sustenance rather than animals.
						This chanage in habitat resaults in increased mosquito presence and associated risks within urban environments.
					</p>
					<p>
						By comparing the countries affected by agriculture and urbanization with their respective death rates
						displayed on the death rate map, we can see there is a clear correlation. 
						Most of the countries affected by urbanization and agriculture are the same ones with the highest death rates.
						This observation shows the significant impact of humans on mosquitoes.

					<h2>Conclusion</h2>
					<p>
						Our analysis shows the impact of malaria across numerous African countries,
						particularly those in the central region of the continent. Over a span of 
						30 years, malaria has caused approximately 6 million deaths in Africa. 
						This disease is an issue in Africa, mostly affecting children under 5 years old 
						and adults who spend most of their time outdoors. 
					</p>
					<p>
						While Nigeria is the country with the highest total number of malaria-related deaths,
						Sierra Leone stands out for the highest death toll relative to its population size.
						Additionally, countries with higher death rates often are the ones with
						increased urbanization and agricultural development.
					</p>
					<p>	
						This analysis is useful for individuals seeking insights into the effects of malaria
						in Africa. Moreover, it provides an understanding for developing strategies to address
						and mitigate this issue.
